# hash-table-of-numbers-using-double-hashing
The idea of the program is similar to double hashing techniques but little different .In double hashing the function is using two hashes at the same time which makes a  problem too complex .the function i am using is f(i) = i1 +i2+....   which is working in the fixed data size and easier to understand.
